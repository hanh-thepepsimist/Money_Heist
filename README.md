## 1. Objectives
### This project aims to classify Vietnamese cashes from 1000 VND to 500000 VND /n The smaller notes, including denominations of 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 5,000 which are no longer printed, yet still widely accepted, are made from cotton. The second and most important kind of note is made from a polymer plastic. These are the notes that are currently printed and they exist in denominations of 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000 and 500,000. The largest note is usually equivalent to around 25 USD.
